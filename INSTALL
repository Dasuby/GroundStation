This is just a draft at the moment - it'll grow with time and might
even be useful one day.....

I suspect that this software only works with linux - as I have no Macs
or windows machines thats probably the way it will stay.

Firsly Gnuradio 3.7 needs to be installed & working. Then we need the
satellite prediction library:

1) Download the library from http://www.danrw.com/sgp4-satellite.php
(there's a link to the zip file at the bottom of the page) and unzip
it and cd into the new directory.

2) On debian unstable I had to then:
  a. Run 'aclocal'
  b. Run 'automake --add-missing'
  c. Run './configure'
  d. Change line in ./Makefile:
      
 AM_CXXFLAGS = -DNDEBUG -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Wextra -Werror -W -Wall -Wconversion

     to be:

 AM_CXXFLAGS = -DNDEBUG -O2 -fomit-frame-pointer -Wextra -Werror -W -Wall -Wconversion -fPIC

     this is so we can make a relocatable library (required as we will
     be making a shared library).

   e. make ; make install
   f. An include file isn't installed that needs to be, so I then had to do

       'cp libsgp4/DecayedException.h /usr/local/include'

      (I was installing into the default /usr/local directory)

      I've contacted the author about the -fPIC & missing include, but
      have not had a responce yet.

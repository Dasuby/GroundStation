This is just a draft at the moment - it'll grow with time and might
even be useful one day.....

I suspect that this software only works with linux - as I have no Macs
or windows machines, thats probably the way it will stay unless people
send me patches.

The Receivers.py module needs to have pyrtlsdr
(https://github.com/roger-/pyrtlsdr) installed in order to extract
information (especially the serial number) so that dongle specific info
(such as frequency corrections) can be stored and correctly associated
with that dongle.

Firstly Gnuradio 3.7 needs to be installed & working. Then we need the
satellite prediction library:

1) Download the library from http://www.danrw.com/sgp4 (there's a link
to the zip file at the bottom of the page) and unzip it and cd into
the new directory.

2) On debian unstable I had to then:
  a.   Change the line in ./configure.ac:
      
  AM_CXXFLAGS="-g       -O0                      -Werror -Wextra -W -Wall -Wconversion"

     to be:

  AM_CXXFLAGS="-g       -O0                      -Werror -Wextra -W -Wall -Wconversion -fPIC"

     this is so we can make a relocatable library (required as we will
     be making a shared library).

  b. Run 'aclocal'
  c. Run 'automake --add-missing'
  d. Run './configure'
  e. make ; make install
  f. An include file isn't installed that needs to be, so I then had to do

       'cp libsgp4/DecayedException.h /usr/local/include'

      (I was installing into the default /usr/local directory)

      I've contacted the author about the -fPIC & missing include, but
      have not had a response yet.

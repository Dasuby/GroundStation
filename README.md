GroundStation
=============

Python/Qt4/GnuRadio suite for receiving satellites.

Of interest to some will be the gr-doppler module which allows
real-time Doppler corrections of signal from satellites in a GRC
friendly manner (although I wouldn't really use it like that due to
the need for ephemeris etc. info that has to be passed to it).
